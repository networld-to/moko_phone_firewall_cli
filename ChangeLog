	* src/pf-cli.c:
	Starting with the implementation of a simple command line interface.
	At the moment there is only implemented the add function for black-
	and whitelist and help (--help or -h) for it. The later function will
	be follow stepwise.

	* include/*:
	The Headerfiles of the phone firewall.

	* lib/libphonefirewall.so:
	The phonefirewall as a dynamic library. Compile for the arm4t
	architecture (for our Freerunner).

	* phonefirewall.sql:
	SQL creation syntax for a black- and whitelist. At the moment is
	necessary to create the database manually (in the opkg package we will
	automate this).

	* env-export:
	Script for the set up of the environment variables for the
	cross compiling.
